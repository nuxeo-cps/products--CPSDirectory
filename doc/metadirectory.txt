====================
MetaDirectory Design

Introduction
============

A meta-directory is a directory whose purpose is to link and redirect
access to parts of an entry to other directories, doing some conversions
in the process.

Reading, writing, creating, deleting and searches are all dispatched
appropriately to the backing directories.

A meta-directory is typically used to provide a synthesized 'users'
directory for the CPSUserFolder, using several backing directories for
different user properties, and also optionaly separate directories for
the groups and roles.

Features
========

Multiple backing directories for one entry
------------------------------------------

An entry of a meta-directory can be built from the corresponding entries
of several other directories, called the backing directories.

For each backing directory, the following must be specified:

- how the id of the meta-directory is converted into the id of the
  backing directory,

- what fields from the backing directory are used,

- what fields are renamed from the backing directory.

Cross-references
----------------

(not implemented)

Some fields of the meta-directory that are lists can be computed as
cross-references to other directories. When these fields read, they are
computed from a search in cross-referenced directory; when they are
written to, it's actually several entries of the cross-referenced
directory that may be modified.

For each cross-referenced field must be specified:

- to what target directory and field is the cross-reference.

Cross-references are one-way, to get coherent directories the target
field in the target directory must be cross-referenced in the opposite
way.
