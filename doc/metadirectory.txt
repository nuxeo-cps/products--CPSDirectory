MetaDirectory Design

Introduction
============

A meta-directory is a directory whose purpose is to link and redirect to
other directories, doing some conversions in the process.

Reading, writing, creating and searches are all dispatched appropriately
to the backing directories.

A meta-directory is typically used to provide a synthesized 'users'
directory for the CPSUserFolder, using several backing directories for
different user properties, and also optionaly separate directories for
the groups and roles.

Features
========

Multiple backing directories for one entry
------------------------------------------

An entry of a meta-directory can be built from the corresponding entries
of several other directories, called the backing directories.

For each backing directory, the following must be specified:

- how the id of the meta-directory is converted into the id of the
  backing directory,

- what fields from the backing directory are used,

- what fields are renamed from the backing directory.

Secondary id field for id conversion
------------------------------------

Sometimes the "real" value for the id of an entry in the backing
directory cannot be used directly as a value for the id of the
meta-directory. In this case, the backing directory must have a
canonical "secondary" id attribute and the means to convert between the
real and secondary id.

When the backing directory is LDAP, its id is the dn. This is usually
never an acceptable value for the id of the meta-directory. In this case
a conversion from the dn to the secondary attribute must be performed.
For LDAP the conversions are performed as followed, using 'uid' as an
example for the secondary attribute:

- dn to uid: if the rdn of the dn is uid, then extract its value,
  otherwise lookup the entry and get the value for the uid.

- uid to dn: if the rdn of the directory is uid and the directory is
  ONELEVEL, then build the dn using the base_dn, otherwise do a search
  of all the entries for the uid, and return the dn of the result
  (assuming there is exactly one result).

Cross-references
----------------

Some fields of the meta-directory that are lists can be computed as
cross-references to other directories. When these fields read, they are
computed from a search in cross-referenced directory; when they are
written to, it's actually several entries of the cross-referenced
directory that may be modified.

For each cross-referenced field must be specified:

- to what target directory and field is the cross-reference.

Cross-references are one-way, to get coherent directories the target
field in the target directory must be cross-referenced in the opposite
way.
