Context
=======

LDAPServerAccess objects are used to centralized LDAP connection and bind
parameters. Existing CPS portals with LDAPBackingDirectory instances need to
be upgraded. 

This job can be done automatically with the dedicated upgrade step:
*Factorize LDAP binds in LDAP Server Access objects*. 

The purpose of this document is to explain what this step does and what to 
do with profiles.

Upgrade step details
====================

The upgrade step extracts the connection and bind parameters from directory
objects, stores them in LDAP Server Access objects, which in turn get 
referenced in the directory instances.

For a given set of parameters, only one server access will be created. Its name
will be deduced from the first encountered directory with these parameters.

The upgrade step is also able to recognize pre-existing server access objects 
and use them. 

So, if you want to decide the name of some server access object, just
create it in portal_directories and fill it with the correct parameters before 
running the step. By correct, we mean the exact same ones as in the directories
to migrate. Please note also that it's very likely that you won't be able to
read them from the Properties tab of these directories after the server has
been restarted with the new code, but you can still see them in the 
Introspection tab if ZMInstropection is installed.

Upgrade your profiles
=====================

If your directory configuration is maintained through a profile, please take
care to remove the following properties for CPS LDAP Backing Directory objects:

    - ldap_server
    - ldap_port
    - ldap_use_ssl
    - ldap_bind_dn
    - ldap_bind_password

Alternatively, you can just use the export ZMI tab on the directories (but this
dumps all properties, and you might now want that)
