CPS Directory, when used for members, provides indirections to two
basic components:

- The User Folder for basic user information (user ID, password,
  role, groups). It will be accessed directly to get the relevant
  information. As there is no standardized API for everything, we
  must take into account:

  + Basic User Folder

  + User Folder With Groups

  + LDAP User Folder

  + Pluggable User Folder

  + GRUF

- The MemberData Tool for access to member properties. This is
  dealt with differently according to the user folder:

  + Basic User Folder: standard CMF MemberData Tool

  + User Folder With Groups: standard CMF MemberData Tool

  + LDAP User Folder: CMFLDAP

  + Pluggable User Folder: tool to do

  + GRUF: ?

  The access needed includes searching members. As there is no
  standard (or sufficiently powerful) API to do a multi-field search,
  it must be implemented for each kind of user folder as an add-on
  (probably a monkey-patch XXX) which I'll call the search component.

When searching for multiple fields, for instance ``email='foo'``
and ``groups='bar'``, the work has to be done by the search
component which means that the search component must *also* know
about roles and groups. The CMF MemberData Tool doesn't know how
to do that. Plone has extended the Membership Tool to give it a
searchForMembers method that knows about name, email, roles,
last_login_time. It could be extended to do more.
