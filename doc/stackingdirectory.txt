StackingDirectory Design

Introduction
============

A stacking directory is a directory whose purpose is to provide a
consolidated view of several other directories that all have the same
schema.

Reading, writing, creating and searches are dispatched to the
appropriate backing directory.

A stacking directory is typically used to provide a synthesized 'users'
directory for the CPSUserFolder, using several backing directories to
store different kinds of users.

Features
========

Several backing directories can be provided, they are ordered.

Id prefixes and suffixes
------------------------

For each backing directory, a prefix for the ids can be specified. The
prefix can be stripped or not when passed to the backing directory.

For instance if we there are two backing directories A and B, with
respective prefixes 'a_' and 'b_', then a request for an entry with id
'a_foo' will automatically be directed to the directory A. In this
directory the entry will have id 'foo' if the prefix is stripped, or
'a_foo' if not.

Finding the backing directory
-----------------------------

When an entry is accessed, the request is always passed to exactly one
backing directory.

To choose this directory, several strategies are used. First, prefixes
or suffixes can restrict the potential backing directories to use. Then,
if several directories are still available (which is the case when no
prefixes or suffixes are used), then the entry is looked up in each
directory in order until one is found.

For creation, the backing directory in which the entry is to be created
can be specified through a TALES expression that may access the fields
of the entry.
