StackingDirectory Design

Introduction
============

A stacking directory is a directory whose purpose is to provide a
consolidated view of several other directories that all have the same
schema.

Reading, writing, creating and searches are dispatched to the
appropriate backing directory.

A stacking directory is typically used to provide a synthesized 'users'
directory for the CPSUserFolder, using several backing directories to
store different kinds of users.

Features
========

Several backing directories can be provided, they are ordered.

Finding the backing directory
-----------------------------

When an entry is looked up, it is looked up in each backing directory in
order until it is found.

For creation, the backing directory in which the entry is to be created
is specified directly by name.
