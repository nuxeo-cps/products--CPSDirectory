Introduction
============

A stacking directory is a directory whose purpose is to provide a
consolidated view of several other directories that all have the
same schema.

Reading, writing, creating and searches are dispatched to the
appropriate backing directory.

A stacking directory is typically used to provide a synthesized
user's directory for the CPSUserFolder, using several backing
directories to store different kinds of users.

Features
========

Several backing directories can be provided; they are used in
order when looking for an entry.

An important feature of a stacking directory is that the ID field
of a backing directory may be different than the one of the
stacking directory itself. However the ID field of the stacking
directory must still be present in the entries of the backing
directory.

This feature is typically used with an LDAP backing directory,
whose ID field is 'dn'. The stacking directory's ID field can be
set to 'uid' for instance, and things will still work.


Finding the backing directory
-----------------------------

When an entry is looked up, it is looked up in each backing
directory in order until it is found.

Searching an entry searches in all backing directories and
aggregates results.

When creating an entry, the backing directory in which the entry
is to be created is specified directly in the stacking directory's
properties.
