Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- LDAPBackingDirectory is now Cache-aware, and can be used with
  a RAM Cache Manager. Caching is done at the lowest LDAP level, so
  doesn't depend on user or rights.
- SQLDirectory is now Cache-aware too.
- RAM Cache Managers can be added directly in portal_directories. Typical
  configuration should remove the AUTHENTICATED_USER from the keywords.
- hasEntry now checks security, _hasEntry is the unrestricted method.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- i18n fix on role labels translations (Member & Manager)
- Taking advantage of the new centralized CPSI18n.tests.translations module.
- Fixed translation files through the CPSI18n/bin/fix_pos script.
- SQLDirectory searchEntries failed to return correct results when no
  return_fields were specified.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Unit tests for SQLDirectory.
