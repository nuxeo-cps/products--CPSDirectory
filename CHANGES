Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
- remove all entries stored in an indirect directory instance, or delete the
  directory.
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Indirect directories can now store entries coming from different directories.
  (compatibility is broken with previous instances of Indirect directory if
  these instances are not empty)
- Local directory 'directory_id' property has been changed from string to list
  because it is used for indirect directories, and new methods used for indirect
  directories have been added in LocalDirectory.
- A new type of vocabulary, indirect directory vocabulary, is used to get all
  the possible entries for an indirect directory.
