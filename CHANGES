Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Basic SQLDirectory, to store data into an SQL table.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Used "Products.CMFCore.permissions" instead of deprecated
  "Products.CMFCore.CMFCorePermissions".
- ZODBDirectory.createEntry: correctly cleanup entry object.
- fix #474: Make sure search didn't return alternate casing, this could be the
  case for LDAP.
- DirectoryWidget: getIdAndTitle did not check if id was None before trying to
  get information from directory - this led to useless searches at creation
  time, for instance.
New internal features:

- manage_addCPSDirectory() takes a **kw args that is propagated to the cls constructor
