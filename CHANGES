Requires:

New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added a new type of directory that just stores links towards entries of
  another directory (Indirect Directory)
- Changed Local Directory to be able to use Local Directory with an
  Indirect directory that would be created automatically.
  WARNING: directory_id does not refer to the id of the directory created
  locally (this one will have the same id than the directory with type
  'CPS Local Directory'), but is used when creating an indirect directory
  locally : it is the id of the directory it refers to (entries will be links
  to entries of that directory).
- Changed the default members layout: now available roles are only the global
  roles 'Manager' and 'Member'. The widget used is a Generic MultiSelect
  widget that displays checkboxes.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Local Directory: fixed a bug related to the fact that the admin is not
  always a member of the site, but should be able to access to the directory
  properties.

New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add the translated attributes for *Select Widgets
