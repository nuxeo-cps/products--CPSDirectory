Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- MD5 and (non salted) SHA capability in LDAPBackingDirectory.
- #1702: Added new Catalan translation thanks to Santi Camps.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Since any type of directory can be used for groups (like ZODBDirectory)
  the hasSubGroupsSupport method is moved to the BaseDirectory. This
  is necessary for the groups to work after an upgrade from CPS 3.2.
- removed harcoded reference to "id" in getDirectoryResultFields.py
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Using testing environment utilities for LDAPBackingDirectory tests.
