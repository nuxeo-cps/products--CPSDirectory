Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- #1805: Add DateTime type to the method match ofCPSDirectory.utils
- Fixed XHTML validity in directory entry form.
- Synced with CPSDocument and CPSDefault fix for #1806 "Fields with errors have
  their error message not associated them and too far below".
- Made the cpsdirectory_entry_created.py script swicth to the
  "cpsdirectory_entry_edit_form" or the "cpsdirectory_entry_view" page depending
  on the ACL rights of the current user over the entry. Typically this is to be
  able to deal with cases where some kind of managers are able to create entries
  but not to modify them.
- #1809: Cannot authenticate against very restricted LDAP server
- #1810: Directories can be globally set to read-only
