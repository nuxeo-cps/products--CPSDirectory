New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Removed obsolete widget types registration.
- Made cross(S|G)etList methods registered on the

  part of the DirectoryTool but in a seperate non persistent util module.

- CPSDirectory.utils.QueryMatcher: small object to prepare queries/match them with
  entries.
